## Welcome!

I am a PhD student in Economics at the [Department of Economics](https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-economics), Copenhagen Business School. My research seeks to study and understand the dynamics of micro-level sources of resource misallocations and bargaining failure in the process of economic development.
