### War and Peace: Evidence from borders of civil war peace accords in Africa

I study how armed groups' behaviour changes in temporal and spatial proximity to peace agreement signatures in civil conflicts in Africa between 1997 to 2019. At the armed group level I match their movements in space with the timing of peace agreement signatures, distinguishing between signatory and non-signatory groups. I find a general decrease in conflict at the spatial and temporal discontinuity immediately after the signature. Meanwhile, the analysis suggests that signatory groups engage in more direct confrontations with other armed groups ahead of the signature and move away from areas of previous activity post signature. The findings help inform our understanding of strategic interactions of signatory versus barely non-signatory groups, with implications for provisions and spatial inclusiveness of peace deals.


### Gone with the wind: the welfare effect of desert locust outbreaks

<!--[Stefano Tripodi](https://stefanotripodi.netlify.app/)-->

Desert locust outbreaks and other pests pose a significant threat to food security for millions of people. In this paper we quantify the size of the productivity and welfare loss caused by a desert locust outbreak that happened in Ethiopia in 2014. We identify the causal effect of locust swarms on agricultural output and children’s nutritional status by modelling their movements based on wind speed and direction to distinguish areas in which they likely land (affected areas). We find that agricultural output and children’s nutritional status is significantly lower in areas hit by the shock compared to areas that are not affected.


### Financial deepening and the informal economy: Evidence from local credit cycles in India
with [Gabriel Züllig](https://gabrielzuellig.ch/)

We analyse the role of formal credit on the size and dynamics of the shadow economy in India, an economy with a large informal sector and large cross-sectional and time heterogeneity in bank credit availability. We use district-level bank lending data from the Reserve Bank of India from 1997 to 2018 and measure light emissions observed from outer space at night time to proxy for economic activity. The identification strategy relies on the importance of gold as a collateral commodity for credit in India. We find that gold price fluctuations have a significantly expanding effect on credit supply, particularly in times and places with ex ante tight lending constraints. Credit supply expansions lead to growth of formal GDP (with a structural elasticity between 0.1 and 0.2). According to our estimates, resources are re-allocated from the informal to the formal sector. In the short run, the contraction of the informal sector is so strong that economic output as a whole tends to fall. The economy reaps the benefits of formalization after credit becomes more easily available only over the course of 3-5 years.
