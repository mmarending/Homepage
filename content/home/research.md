### War and Peace: Evidence from borders of civil war peace accords in Africa

 The nexus between peace agreement and conflict is riddled with endogeneity bias as neither the content of the agreement nor reaching a deal in the first place are independent of conflict dynamics. In this paper I exploit spatial discontinuities to uncover the causal effect of peace agreements on civil conflict dynamics by signatory and non-signatory armed groups in Africa between 1998 and 2019. Based on the conflict events per group I construct dynamic spatial extents of observed armed group presence in violent events, which I instrument using a theory-based spatial partition of Africa, specifically an annual voronoi tesselation using the weighted centroids of the armed groups’ territorial extent over the past two years. These plausibly exogenous discontinuities are matched to the signatories of 414 peace agreements. As some of these groups participated in peace negotiations and signed a deal while others did not, I recover the average treatment effect of peace agreements on civil conflict dynamics using a spatial regression discontinuity design. Looking at yearly-grid-cells in the vicinity of the discontinuity, I find that peace agreements reduce the incidence of violence by 24 percent in the year of signing. The findings help inform our understanding of the interaction between peace agreements as potential relative power shifters between signatory and non-signatory armed groups, with implications for provisions and inclusiveness of peace deals.
 


### Gone with the wind: the welfare effect of desert locust outbreaks

Desert locust outbreaks and other pests pose a significant threat to food security for millions of people. In this paper we quantify the size of the productivity and welfare loss caused by a desert locust outbreak that happened in Ethiopia in 2014. We identify the causal effect of locust swarms on agricultural output and children’s nutritional status by modelling their movements based on wind speed and direction to distinguish areas in which they likely land (affected areas). We find that agricultural output and children’s nutritional status is significantly lower in areas hit by the shock compared to areas that are not affected.


### Financial deepening and the informal economy: Evidence from local credit cycles in India
with [Gabriel Züllig](https://gabrielzuellig.ch/)

We analyse the role of formal credit on the size and dynamics of the shadow economy in India, an economy with a large informal sector and large cross-sectional and time heterogeneity in bank credit availability. We use district-level bank lending data from the Reserve Bank of India from 1997 to 2018 and measure light emissions observed from outer space at night time to proxy for economic activity. The identification strategy relies on the importance of gold as a collateral commodity for credit in India. We find that gold price fluctuations have a significantly expanding effect on credit supply, particularly in times and places with ex ante tight lending constraints. Credit supply expansions lead to growth of formal GDP (with a structural elasticity between 0.1 and 0.2). According to our estimates, resources are re-allocated from the informal to the formal sector. In the short run, the contraction of the informal sector is so strong that economic output as a whole tends to fall. The economy reaps the benefits of formalization after credit becomes more easily available only over the course of 3-5 years.
