### War and Peace: Evidence from borders of civil war peace accords in Africa

 The nexus between peace agreement and conflict is riddled with endogeneity bias as neither the content of the agreement nor reaching a deal in the first place are independent of conflict dynamics. In this paper I exploit spatial discontinuities to uncover the causal effect of peace agreements on civil conflict dynamics by signatory and non-signatory armed groups in Africa between 1998 and 2019. Based on the conflict events per group I construct dynamic spatial extents of observed armed group presence in violent events, which I instrument using a theory-based spatial partition of Africa, specifically an annual voronoi tesselation using the weighted centroids of the armed groups’ territorial extent over the past two years. These plausibly exogenous discontinuities are matched to the signatories of 414 peace agreements. As some of these groups participated in peace negotiations and signed a deal while others did not, I recover the average treatment effect of peace agreements on civil conflict dynamics using a spatial regression discontinuity design. Looking at yearly-grid-cells in the vicinity of the discontinuity, I find that peace agreements reduce the incidence of violence by 24 percent in the year of signing. The findings help inform our understanding of the interaction between peace agreements as potential relative power shifters between signatory and non-signatory armed groups, with implications for provisions and inclusiveness of peace deals.


### Agricultural Pests and Intra-household Resource Allocation: Evidence from Ethiopia
with Stefano Tripodi <!--[Stefano Tripodi](https://stefanotripodi.netlify.app/)-->

Under normal circumstances households in developing countries do not necessarily favor male children over fe- male children. However, in light of adverse shocks and resulting economic hardship, more vulnerable households are faced with life and death decisions which might favor boys over girls. We test the existence of gender-based discrimination in food allocation exploiting a pure agricultural shock affecting rural and urban households in Ethiopia. Using a DiD approach, we estimate the effect of the pest on agricultural productivity for house- holds living in proximity to the observed and predicted location of the shock (affected households) and compare changes in nutritional outcomes for children living in affected households to changes in the same outcomes for children not affected by the shock. Initial results suggest that agricultural yields are significantly lower for af- fected households and girls living in these households are not disproportionately affected by the negative shock, compared to boys


### Financial Deepening and the Informal Economy: Evidence from Local Credit Cycles in India
with [Gabriel Züllig](https://gabrielzuellig.ch/)

The informal sector in India is estimated to constitute over 50 percent of overall Gross Value Added, with an estimated employment share larger than 90 percent of the Indian working age population. We analyse the role of formal credit on the size and dynamics of the shadow economy in India between 1997 and 2018 using district- level bank lending data from the Reserve Bank of India and light emissions observed from outer space at night time to proxy for economic activity. The identification strategy relies on the importance of gold as a collateral commodity for credit in India. We find that gold price fluctuations have a significant effect on credit supply, particularly in times and places with ex ante tight lending constraints. Credit supply expansions lead to growth of formal GDP (with a structural elasticity between 0.1 and 0.2) but only moderate increases in total economic activity. Our estimates imply that real GDP gains are partially offset by declines in the informal sector because access to credit requires a formalisation of economic activity.
